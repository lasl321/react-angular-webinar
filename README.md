# Initial
* Modules
* Component models
* Now we have the experience
* Want to be able to deal with multiple technologies
* Compose applications
* Experiences from smaller teams
* Functional languages lend themselves more to emergent architectures

# Components
* Use dumb components

# Stateless
* Hard to understand
* Alternative is pure functions
* Easier to understand
* No history

# Other libraries 
* RxJs
 * Data as streams
* ImmutableJS
* Redux
 * Concept is reducing actions
* As in map/reduce
* History can be rolled back and replayed

# React or Angular
* Can do either, but redux is react

# Notes
* More complex state suggests looking at functional approaches
